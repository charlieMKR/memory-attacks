The goal of this repo is to educate myself on memory attacks.

### Useful stuff: GCC flags

- `-fno-stack-protector`: No stack canaries
- `-m32`: Compile 32 bit executable
- `-O0`: Dissable optimizations
- `-ggdb`: Produce debugging information for use by GDB
### Other notes
- If you are on linux, 64 bits, install `gcc-multilib`
